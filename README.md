### Where it began
* I successfully completed the renowned Northcoders full stack development bootcamp at the beginning of 2021. During my time I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, SQL, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Jest, SuperTest, HTML5, CSS3, RESTful API development, Git and development best practices like Pair Programming and TDD.

### Where am I now?
* Working for a software house in Leeds, West Yorkshire. I'm working with a similar stack outlined above, but have been lucky enough to learn Feathers.js, MobX, MySQL on the job. Due to the situation with the Covid pandemic, there as been a lot of remote collaboration and pairing via Slack/Zoom.
